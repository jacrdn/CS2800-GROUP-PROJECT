# CS2800 GROUP PROJECT: Proving Iterative Palindromization
## Members: Jack Cardin, Jalen Gonel, Eric Yip

This repository contains the lisp file that holds all of the code related to our mechanized proof.
It also contains the entirety of our pen-and-paper proof.
To access the file, simply open the lisp file labeled "iteratively-palindromize_FINAL_DRAFT.lisp" in ACL2s and run the code.
